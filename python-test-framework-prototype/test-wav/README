Test wave files.

Conversion to a PJSUA compatible format can be done using sox with the following parameters:

  sox original.wav -c1 -r 16000 infile.wav

If there is a need to trim down on wave file length, the trim filter can be applied, like so.

  sox original.wav -c1 -r 16000 infile.wav trim 10 5

The example above will give a sequence of 5 second length, starting from position 10 seconds in the original file.
The other parameters can be omitted
