GNAT.Sockets extras [1]
=======================

Packages to make life easier, when you write networking applications using
GNAT.Sockets.

GNAT.Sockets.Convenience - sets up typically configured client and server
                           sockets in one operation.
GNAT.Sockets.Compatibility - allows you to operate on GNAT sockets using the
                             standard POSIX Ada API.


Included tests:
---------------

The repository comes with two ready-to-use test cases:

1) 'cyclomatic_complexity' - reports excessive cyclomatic complexities in the
   project sources.

2) 'unused_units' - warns about units which aren't compiled.
