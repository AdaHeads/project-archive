Ada development Makefile
=========

This is a primitive automagic wrapper around the tedious and manual process
of installing and building Ada tools.

It's created to scratch a local itch within our company - but could perhaps be
used elsewhere.

Dependencies
------------

Not much is needed for using this makefile;
  * make (obviously)
  * git (for AWS and Yolk)
  * subversion (for GNATColl)
  * any dependencies for the subprojects obviously still applies.
  * sudo, gksudo, su if you want to install to a system location

Usage
-----

Check out the first few lines of the makefile - or just use make ada-development to get stated.


Have fun!
