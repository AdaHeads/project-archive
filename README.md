Receptionist browser-based console for Alice.

This project currently hold two implementations of the Client;
JavaScript and Dart.

The JavaScript client is easier to deploy and develop on, but alas,
is still JavaScript. 

The Dart client requires some more work, which is documented here:

- Enjoy.
